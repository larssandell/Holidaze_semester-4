# Holidaze Accommodation Booking Application

This repository contains the front-end application for the Holidaze accommodation booking site. The goal of this project is to develop a modern and user-friendly front end that showcases the candidate's development capabilities, visual skills, and technical expertise. The application will interact with an existing API to provide various functionalities to users.

## Brief

Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site, has approached us to build a brand new front end for their application. While they have outlined the required features, the design and user experience are open for interpretation. Using the official API documentation provided, our task is to plan, design, and build a modern front end for the accommodation booking application.

The project has two main aspects: a customer-facing side where users can book holidays at various venues, and an admin-facing side where users can register, manage venues, and bookings.

## Requirements

The front-end application will rely on the existing API to handle the back-end functionality. Our responsibility is to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that seamlessly integrates with the API. The API documentation for this project can be found under "Holidaze" in the Noroff API documentation.
